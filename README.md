# ML-under-the-hood

This repository have implementation of various machine learning algorithms

Many code and concepts follow [Stanford Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), so if you are taking the class follow stanfor honor code. But as you can see some examples are different and represent different problems

## Stanford Honor Code

> "We strongly encourage students to form study groups,  and discuss the lecture videos (including in-video questions). We also encourage you to get together with friends to watch the videos together as a group. However,  the answers that you submit for the review questions should be your own work. For the programming exercises,  you are welcome to discuss them with other students,  discuss specific algorithms,  properties of algorithms,  etc.; we ask only that you not look at any source code written by a different student,  nor show your solution code to other students."
